In the middle of compiling the grammar.

- symbol canon
  - want to canonicalize the constructor string
  - and also the symbol pointer?

- remove unused mrd terms like 'or'

- and what about unary ops?

- is {} an empty array, or an empty map?
  - polymorphic!

- self-hosting grammar
  + write good grammar
  + parse all of it
  - make it nicer
    - 'macro' for *-lists and +-lists
    - 'macro' for joins, e.g. exp , exp , exp
  - use it to parse

- maybe
  - memoization of string construction?
  - should hash modify its own table size?
